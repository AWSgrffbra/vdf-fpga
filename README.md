# VDF FPGA Competition Baseline Model

This repository contains the modular squaring multiplier baseline design for the upcoming VDF low latency multiplier competition (stay tuned for more details). The model is designed to be highly paramaterized with support for a variety of bit widths. 

The algorithm used is a pipelined version of the multiplier developed by Erdinc Ozturk of Sabanci University and described in detail at MIT VDF Day 2019 (https://dci.mit.edu/video-gallery/2019/5/29/survey-of-hardware-multiplier-techniques-new-innovations-in-low-latency-multipliers-e-ozturk). 

The model is not yet finalized. Expect to see changes leading up the competition start. Please reach out with any questions, comments, or feedback to hello@supranational.net.

See msu/README.md for information about how to use this model.
